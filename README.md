# Number-Guesser-Game
This game is a simple python game that generates a random number from either 1-10, 1-50, or 1-100 depending on what difficulty the user picks. The user then tries to guess the number in the given amount of chances which varies each difficulty. The game gives hints as to what the number is along the way. (Codedex project 4/50)
